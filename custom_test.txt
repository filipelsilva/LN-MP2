TRUTHFULPOSITIVE Amazing stay! We could not be more happy with our experience at the LN hotel! The personel was fantastic and so nice, the check-in was quick and the food they served at their own restaurant is out of this world. We are deinitly coming back the next opportunity we have!
DECEPTIVENEGATIVE BLASPHEMOUS! As soon I set one single foot at the hotel, a dark presence emanated the room as if to tell me I'm not welcome. I pushed through this aura to meet with a lady with a creepy smile at the reception desk. Extra points for the swiftness. Negative points for the creepy smile. The place was dimly lit as I walked into my room, I almost got lost in that dark labyrinth. When I got to my room, there were crosses all over the place and, as I tried to get some sleep, I could hear them turning against the wall. As soon as I woke up from my quick nap that felt like years, I see the horrifying scenario of all the upside down crosses and a small shadow lurking by the curtains. I ran out of there as fast as I could. Overall, wouldn't recommend it unless you are Stephen King himself.
DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE goddamn that was some good stuff. amazng amzing time!!!!!!!!
TRUTHFULPOSITIVE I stayed at the Silva hotel and were not expecting much due to the low price, but what a deal! The great price paired with the excellent night and service are definitly defining factors of a good hotel. Definitly a recommendation!
TRUTHFULNEGATIVE What a letdown. Such a good rating and positive comments but it definitly comes short of its promises since everything was mediocre.
DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE During our trip to America we had the best experience we have ever had at a hotel since ever! This hotel is nothing short of perfect. I wish there was a hotel like this in every place we travel to.
DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE Couldn't have asked for better! Perfect employees, huge pool, a comfortable room and great food. This is the greatest hotel I have ever seen!
DECEPTIVENEGATIVE Utter garbage. No explanation needed.
TRUTHFULNEGATIVE We were looking forward to our stay at the L'Baguette hotel until disaster struck. We got a call cancelling our reservation 10 minutes before the check-in. It was the most inconvenient situation they could've put us in since we were already there and every other hotel in the area was full. The reimbursement doesn't even matter in a situation like this, since it won't make it right.
DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE Best hotel in the area no cap. Come and try to stay at the Cali Hotel!
TRUTHFULPOSITIVE Great stay at Sunset Vista Hotel! Friendly staff, clean room with a view, and delicious dining. Perfect location for beachgoers and sightseers.
TRUTHFULNEGATIVE My recent stay at the Sunset Vista Hotel was disappointing. The room was in need of maintenance, with a leaky faucet and outdated decor. The staff seemed disinterested and unresponsive to my concerns. The dining experience left much to be desired, with overpriced and underwhelming meals. The hotel's location was the only redeeming factor. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.
TRUTHFULNEGATIVE I regret my stay at the Pipinho Hotel. The room was dirty, and the staff's attitude was far from welcoming. The noise from neighboring rooms was unbearable, making it impossible to get a good night's sleep. The hotel's amenities were lacking, and the Wi-Fi was slow and unreliable. The only positive was the location, but it couldn't make up for the overall disappointing experience.
